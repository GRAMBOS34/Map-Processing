# Robot Map Processing

I really just don't have a better name for this.

But this is the code to the robot shown during the club selling

Explanations are included in a separate folder

If the code seems unreadable at certain parts I'm sorry I really tried lol
but it's kinda hard to explain trigonometry and pre-calculus to people
who don't understand what those are lol

## How to install (Currently pending)

1. **Install python3 and pip** (find a tutorial for that its pretty easy) OR use an IDE like **Pycharm** or smth

   - Make sure that you add it to PATH if you install on Windows

2. _(Skip this if you used an IDE)_ **Install a code editor**

   - I personally use VS Code but use anything you want

3. Open a terminal in the directory you installed this project and run this command:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Connect it up to the hardware, here's a list
   - Raspberry Pi 4 Model b
   - Makeblock mBot neo
   - Your computer
